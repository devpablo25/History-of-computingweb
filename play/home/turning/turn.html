        A Turing machine is a theoretical computational model that was introduced by Alan Turing in 1936. It consists of
        an infinitely long tape divided into cells, with each cell capable of holding a symbol. A tape head reads and
        writes symbols on the tape and moves left or right according to a set of rules. The machine has a finite set of
        states, including one start state and one or more halting states. The Turing machine operates by transitioning
        between states based on the symbol read on the tape. Each transition is defined by a "transition function,"
        which tells the machine what symbol to write, which direction to move, and what state to enter next. Turing
        machines are used to define the concept of computability and algorithmic processes. They can simulate any
        computation that can be done by any modern computer. Despite their simplicity, Turing machines are powerful
        enough to solve any problem that is algorithmically solvable. The Church-Turing thesis asserts that anything
        computable by a Turing machine is computable by any other computational model, establishing the foundation for
        computer science.
