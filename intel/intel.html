<h5 class="cpucc">The intel 4004</h5>

                <p>The Intel 4004 was the world's first microprocessor, introduced in 1971. It was a 4-bit processor
                    developed by Intel and designed by engineers Federico Faggin, Marcian Hoff, and Stanley Mazor. The
                    4004 was initially created for a calculator made by Busicom, a Japanese company. However, its design
                    was groundbreaking and became a key element in the evolution of computers.</p>

                    <h5 id="cc">Federico Faggin,
                        <br>
                        Marcian Hoff,
                        <br>
                        and Stanley Mazor
                    </h5>
                </div1>
                <p>The Intel 4004 was able to process data in 4-bit chunks, which was a significant step forward in
                    computing technology at the time. It was built using 2,300 transistors, which was a remarkable
                    achievement for the era. The microprocessor had a clock speed of 740 kHz and could address up to 4KB
                    of memory. Despite its limited capabilities by modern standards, the Intel 4004 marked the beginning
                    of the microprocessor revolution and laid the foundation for the development of more powerful
                    processors in the years to come.</p>

                <p>The release of the 4004 also played a pivotal role in the shift towards personal computing. While its
                    original purpose was for calculators, its impact on the computer industry grew as it showed that
                    microprocessors could be used for various applications, leading to the eventual development of more
                    advanced microprocessors that would power personal computers, gaming consoles, and more.</p>
